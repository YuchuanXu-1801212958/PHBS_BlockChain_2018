## **1 Introduction**

As a very important role in human history, money has been accompanied by the development of human civilization, even to a certain extent, a milestone in the development of human civilization. From physical money to weighing money, from paper money to electronic money and digital money, money itself is constantly evolving. On October 31, 2008, a white paper on the design of bitcoin titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was published at the Cryptography Forum by a person who assumed the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code for the implementation of Bitcoin was released in 2009, and the world’s first Bitcoin was born on January 3, 2009, which is also the beginning of the new world of Internet digital currency. Despite many controversies, block chains and Bitcoins, which represent block chains, are still milestones in the development of information technology.

Bitcoin is a digital currency based on the Proof of work Mechanism (PoW). Miners who do bitcoin mining need to use computer CPU/GPU computing power to continually crack one specific problem to obtain rewards. That is a certain amount of bitcoin, this is the mining process of Bitcoin [2]。In the process of solving problems, computing power has become a decisive factor in the calculation speed. The greater the computing power is, the greater the possibility of miners to have priority in the calculation results. Therefore, it will cost a lot of money to participate in mining with PoW mechanism. This also guarantees the security of Bitcoin network to a certain extent, because deliberate attackers have to pay a huge cost, and the cost will increase with the total amount of computing power of miners in Bitcoin network. Because of the algorithm, there are about 21 million special solutions, so the upper limit of Bitcoin is about 21 million. This is very similar to gold mining in real life, and the amount of gold in the earth is limited. At the same time, the difficulty of obtaining special solutions can be changed to control the number of Bitcoins that can be excavated efficiently and conveniently. Because the computing power determines the possibility of mining success, the competition between miners mainly focuses on the performance and quantity of mining machine. In today’s mining market with considerable scale, the mining efficiency of independent miners is not enough. In this case, the pool of joint mining emerges as the market requires. Bitcoin mining has also risen from personal work to group cooperation [3].
