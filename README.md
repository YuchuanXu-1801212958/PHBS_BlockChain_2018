## **1 Introduction**

As a very important role in human history, money has been accompanied by the development of human civilization, even to a certain extent, a milestone in the development of human civilization. From physical money to weighing money, from paper money to electronic money and digital money, money itself is constantly evolving. On October 31, 2008, a white paper on the design of bitcoin titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was published at the Cryptography Forum by a person who assumed the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code for the implementation of Bitcoin was released in 2009, and the world’s first Bitcoin was born on January 3, 2009, which is also the beginning of the new world of Internet digital currency. Despite many controversies, block chains and Bitcoins, which represent block chains, are still milestones in the development of information technology.

Bitcoin is a digital currency based on the Proof of work Mechanism (PoW). Miners who do bitcoin mining need to use computer CPU/GPU computing power to continually crack one specific problem to obtain rewards. That is a certain amount of bitcoin, this is the mining process of Bitcoin [2]。In the process of solving problems, computing power has become a decisive factor in the calculation speed. The greater the computing power is, the greater the possibility of miners to have priority in the calculation results. Therefore, it will cost a lot of money to participate in mining with PoW mechanism. This also guarantees the security of Bitcoin network to a certain extent, because deliberate attackers have to pay a huge cost, and the cost will increase with the total amount of computing power of miners in Bitcoin network. Because of the algorithm, there are about 21 million special solutions, so the upper limit of Bitcoin is about 21 million. This is very similar to gold mining in real life, and the amount of gold in the earth is limited. At the same time, the difficulty of obtaining special solutions can be changed to control the number of Bitcoins that can be excavated efficiently and conveniently. Because the computing power determines the possibility of mining success, the competition between miners mainly focuses on the performance and quantity of mining machine. In today’s mining market with considerable scale, the mining efficiency of independent miners is not enough. In this case, the pool of joint mining emerges as the market requires. Bitcoin mining has also risen from personal work to group cooperation [3].

In Bitcoin trading, both parties need to have "Bitcoin Wallet" and "Bitcoin Address". At present, due to the existence of the Bitcoin Exchange, both sides of the transaction can use mobile phones or personal computers to log on to a Bitcoin trading platform for trading. Online purchase through Bitcoin trading platform is an important channel to acquire Bitcoin. Most of the functions of purchase and discovery can be realized in Bitcoin trading platform. From the data of the major trading platforms in the country, the current amount of Bitcoin transactions is 100,000 per day, which is a good proof of the transaction value of Bitcoin and the possibility of Bitcoin being used as currency in daily life [4,5]. Nowadays, the price trend analysis of the stock, bond, futures, real estate and other investment targets has been relatively comprehensive and mature, but in contrast, the market price of digital currency such as Bitcoin still has a lot of room to explore. Recently, the price of digital currency has also received great attention of the whole society, and the analysis of the price of digital currency has become an urgent need of today’s society, and will also give great help to investors of digital currency. The price analysis of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, refers specifically to the analysis of changes in asset markets and the factors affecting their prices. However, the existing problem is that at this stage, we are all based on "positivism" to analyze the price of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, namely "technical analysis". Some people used economic analysis tools such as formula mathematic model, trend extension line and so on, which are similar to stock analysis. But in fact, in the digital currency market, the accuracy of price prediction by price mathematic model is not high [6].

In the society, speculation is inevitable, and speculation is accompanied by the long history of capitalism. Historically, speculative assets have a common feature, that is, the difficulty of valuation. The South Sea Co bubble and the tulip bubble in Holland reflect the impact of human greed on speculative speculation. At the same time, it is difficult to determine the objective value of assets, and all speculative activities are reflected in the hyperexponential growth of time series [7]. Recently, due to human speculation, the price of digital currencies such as Bitcoin has fluctuated dramatically. If we ignore the human factors in the price analysis as before, it will make it impossible for us to really analyze the price changes of digital currency. I will combine "positivism" and "anthropology" to represent the digital currency market with Bitcoin. It makes a rational and comprehensive analysis of the changes of Bitcoin market and the influencing factors of its price. Firstly, I will analyze the price fluctuation of Bitcoin through investigation, and summarize the main price basis of Bitcoin in the emergence stage. Secondly, we study the current situation of Bitcoin market and present our thinking and hypothesis about the price of Bitcoin. Finally, through empirical analysis of a large number of data to draw regression-related conclusions.


## **2 Research status of bitcoin**

Bitcoin, or block chain technology itself, is the greatest help to human society is to solve the problem of trust between people, people’s distrust of the government and people’s distrust of the economic system, which is particularly evident under the stimulus of the 2008 financial crisis. And Nakamoto put forward a de-centralized point-to-point electronic currency, without a third party, and constructed a new trust system. So, for Bitcoin, the main problem at present is whether it can be regarded as a universal currency, which is mainly determined by whether it has the basic function of currency and the relationship between Bitcoin and other currencies.

Whelan (2013) argues that Bitcoins are similar to the dollar because they do not seem to have real intrinsic value, or only limited value, but are used in life as a medium of exchange. Lo and Wang (2014) and Baur et al. (2017) consider the function of money. The basic function of money includes the medium of exchange, the unit of account and the storage of value. Bitcoin has some deficiencies in these aspects, such as the convenience of its transaction is not enough to meet the standard of general currency. In Bariviera et al. (2017), Bitcoin does not have the basic function of money, because it fluctuates greatly, even more than the currencies of some small countries. Roverds and Velde (2014) analogized Bitcoin to the old gold and silver bills and bills of exchange, which existed as money during the financial revolution of 1688-1756.If Bitcoin is regarded as a currency, it should also be affected by interest rates, similar to other currencies, so it has been examined from this level.

Dyhrberg (2016) based on GARCH model tests whether there is a correlation between Bitcoin returns and the Federal Fund Interest Rate. Because the dollar will appreciate as fund interest rates rise, this will lead to an increase in imports, and because of Bitcoin’s advantages in Transnational Online transactions, the demand for Bitcoin will increase, so the return on Bitcoin investment will increase. At the same time, it also reflects that Bitcoin performs well in the function of trading media, which means that Bitcoin and currency have certain similarities.

Secondly, another characteristic of money is that it is influenced by other countries’ currencies. Szetelaet al. (2016) inspected the relationship between Bitcoin and the currencies with great influence, such as US dollar, Euro, British pound and RMB. Based on ARMA and GARCH model, the conditional mean and conditional variance of Bitcoin were selected as data. It was found that conditional mean and conditional variance had nothing to do with other currencies, but conditional variance had a certain correlation, which indicated that Bitcoin was not complete. From this point of view, we can prove the monetary attribute of Bitcoin, which is totally independent of other currencies.

Bouoiyouret al. (2016) believes that the price of Bitcoin is affected by many factors, including supply and demand, exchange volume, circulation rate and Bitcoin output. Others argue that in the long run, supply and demand are the most important factors affecting the price of Bitcoin (Buchholz et al. (2012)).Van Wijk (2013) believes that the price of Bitcoin is closely related to the development of the global financial market, and the prosperity of the financial market determines the change of the price of Bitcoin. In addition, Ciaianet al. (2016) and Bouoiyou and Selmi (2015) found that real transactions and exchanges made Bitcoin holdings more meaningful, which caused the price of Bitcoin to rise. Ciaianet al. (2016) considers many factors as data at the same time, including traditional factors such as supply and demand, and the specific factor of Bitcoin’s attractiveness to investors. Using data from 2009-2015 and using time series analysis, the results of the study found that the power of supply and demand, the attractiveness of Bitcoin to investors and users all have a significant impact on bitcoin prices, but the impact also changes over time.

In the short term, Bitcoin prices fluctuate greatly. It is generally believed that there are many factors that affect its price, such as Twitter, Google search and other factors. Bouri et al. (2017) found that in terms of the impact of news on Bitcoin, the impact of positive shocks was greater.

Thereafter, the study on the price of Bitcoin should focus on the following aspects:

+ (1) The unique trading mechanisms of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, including 24-hour continuous trading and the co-operation of several large exchanges, may lead to different measurement methods in the study. At the same time, the frequency of data selection should also be carefully considered. At present, most studies use Bitcoin daily data to study in terms of date, but because of the 24-hour continuity of its transactions, such segmentation may lead to the loss of internal information. At the same time, choosing different intervals may lead to different results.

+ (2) Although current research shows that the price of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the overall situation of the financial market, because Bitcoin currently mainly covers the field of science and technology, it may be related to the development of specific sectors related to science and technology. In the current financial market, under the background of the hot concept of the block chain, the stock prices of companies involved in the block chain have risen considerably. Most of them are technology companies. Therefore, even if it has nothing to do with the overall financial market, it can not be ruled out that Bitcoin is related to technology and other related sectors.

+ (3) As a kind of digital currency, Bitcoin still occupies a large proportion of the market share in the current situation of a large number of digital currencies, but it still has the possibility of interacting with other kinds of digital currencies, so it is necessary to study this aspect.

+ (4) Bitcoin has developed many other applications from the most important application of block chain technology as the foundation, and the emerging technology of block chain technology combined with other technologies has invaded the proportion of special currency in digital currency. This situation Bitcoin is facing is bound to have a negative impact on special currency, but this situation is in the process of development. 

+ (5) Because many investors are hoarding Bitcoin and other digital currencies and waiting the price of these digital currencies to rise, because the total amount of Bitcoin is limited, this will inevitably lead to deflation effect, which is obviously not conducive to the continued development of Bitcoin. Therefore, it is necessary to build a more complete life cycle asset allocation scheme to break the current unhealthy investment mode. With the continuous expansion of market value of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, this phenomenon needs our attention and urgently needs to be solved.

+ (6) At present, digital currencies such as Bitcoin have also developed some derivatives, such as Bitcoin futures trading. The ecology of these derivatives is also worth studying, and the impact of these derivatives on digital currencies such as Bitcoin itself is also a question worthy of careful consideration.

## **3 Bitcoin price fluctuation analysis**

The three main characteristics of money are the medium of exchange, the value of storage and the unit of account. According to economic history, money is closely related to power and politics. At first, money was made of metal, and the value of metal itself was the value of money. Later, money was printed on paper, and its value was somewhat related to the amount of gold and endorsed by the government.[8,9] Money itself has value, so it can serve as a measure of value. There is a lack of research on the value of Bitcoin in the market. At the same time, Bitcoin has not formed a consensus in the current society. Therefore, we can regard Bitcoin as a commodity to analyze its price and the factors affecting its price.
