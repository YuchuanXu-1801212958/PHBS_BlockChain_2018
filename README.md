## **1 Introduction**

As a very important role in human history, money has been accompanied by the development of human civilization, even to a certain extent, a milestone in the development of human civilization. From physical money to weighing money, from paper money to electronic money and digital money, money itself is constantly evolving. On October 31, 2008, a white paper on the design of bitcoin titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was published at the Cryptography Forum by a person who assumed the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code for the implementation of Bitcoin was released in 2009, and the world’s first Bitcoin was born on January 3, 2009, which is also the beginning of the new world of Internet digital currency. Despite many controversies, block chains and Bitcoins, which represent block chains, are still milestones in the development of information technology.

Bitcoin is a digital currency based on the Proof of work Mechanism (PoW). Miners who do bitcoin mining need to use computer CPU/GPU computing power to continually crack one specific problem to obtain rewards. That is a certain amount of bitcoin, this is the mining process of Bitcoin [2]。In the process of solving problems, computing power has become a decisive factor in the calculation speed. The greater the computing power is, the greater the possibility of miners to have priority in the calculation results. Therefore, it will cost a lot of money to participate in mining with PoW mechanism. This also guarantees the security of Bitcoin network to a certain extent, because deliberate attackers have to pay a huge cost, and the cost will increase with the total amount of computing power of miners in Bitcoin network. Because of the algorithm, there are about 21 million special solutions, so the upper limit of Bitcoin is about 21 million. This is very similar to gold mining in real life, and the amount of gold in the earth is limited. At the same time, the difficulty of obtaining special solutions can be changed to control the number of Bitcoins that can be excavated efficiently and conveniently. Because the computing power determines the possibility of mining success, the competition between miners mainly focuses on the performance and quantity of mining machine. In today’s mining market with considerable scale, the mining efficiency of independent miners is not enough. In this case, the pool of joint mining emerges as the market requires. Bitcoin mining has also risen from personal work to group cooperation [3].

In Bitcoin trading, both parties need to have "Bitcoin Wallet" and "Bitcoin Address". At present, due to the existence of the Bitcoin Exchange, both sides of the transaction can use mobile phones or personal computers to log on to a Bitcoin trading platform for trading. Online purchase through Bitcoin trading platform is an important channel to acquire Bitcoin. Most of the functions of purchase and discovery can be realized in Bitcoin trading platform. From the data of the major trading platforms in the country, the current amount of Bitcoin transactions is 100,000 per day, which is a good proof of the transaction value of Bitcoin and the possibility of Bitcoin being used as currency in daily life [4,5]. Nowadays, the price trend analysis of the stock, bond, futures, real estate and other investment targets has been relatively comprehensive and mature, but in contrast, the market price of digital currency such as Bitcoin still has a lot of room to explore. Recently, the price of digital currency has also received great attention of the whole society, and the analysis of the price of digital currency has become an urgent need of today’s society, and will also give great help to investors of digital currency. The price analysis of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, refers specifically to the analysis of changes in asset markets and the factors affecting their prices. However, the existing problem is that at this stage, we are all based on "positivism" to analyze the price of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, namely "technical analysis". Some people used economic analysis tools such as formula mathematic model, trend extension line and so on, which are similar to stock analysis. But in fact, in the digital currency market, the accuracy of price prediction by price mathematic model is not high [6].

In the society, speculation is inevitable, and speculation is accompanied by the long history of capitalism. Historically, speculative assets have a common feature, that is, the difficulty of valuation. The South Sea Co bubble and the tulip bubble in Holland reflect the impact of human greed on speculative speculation. At the same time, it is difficult to determine the objective value of assets, and all speculative activities are reflected in the hyperexponential growth of time series [7]. Recently, due to human speculation, the price of digital currencies such as Bitcoin has fluctuated dramatically. If we ignore the human factors in the price analysis as before, it will make it impossible for us to really analyze the price changes of digital currency. I will combine "positivism" and "anthropology" to represent the digital currency market with Bitcoin. It makes a rational and comprehensive analysis of the changes of Bitcoin market and the influencing factors of its price. Firstly, I will analyze the price fluctuation of Bitcoin through investigation, and summarize the main price basis of Bitcoin in the emergence stage. Secondly, we study the current situation of Bitcoin market and present our thinking and hypothesis about the price of Bitcoin. Finally, through empirical analysis of a large number of data to draw regression-related conclusions.
